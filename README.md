# VOC_datastories
Data stories for the VOC thesis projects.

To give insight into the dataset of the VOC, which contains personal record of employees within the VOC, a data story was made by Barry Hendriks and Eva van Dijk in a Jupyter Notebook. There were four main parts for the data story plus an analysis of an individual in the dataset. The four main parts were: a word cloud of the employee's name, the amount of each rank available in the dataset, a map showing places of birth and the amount of employees over time within the VOC. The analysis of the individual focused on extracting information from his notary documents (Barry) and analyzing his career (Eva). 

The dataset that has been used was created by:
