# VOC_datastories
Data stories for the VOC thesis projects

The implementation of the datastories can be found in the jupyter notebook file. This data story tells something about the VOC dataset, which contains personal record of employees within the VOC. In the first part of the data story, the place of birth of employees was analyzed by drawing a map and making multiple graphs. Also, the amount of employees over time was analyzed using a graph to give insight into the growth of the VOC.

The second part of the datastories focused on the career of an individual. Several aspect of his career were highlighted, for example: service time, the amount of travels and promotions/demotions.
